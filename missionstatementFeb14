ITPAA serves alumni and the Program itself by providing a bridge between the academic and professional worlds. 
We seek to spread the playful and collaborative spirit of ITP's community far beyond the Fourth Floor and to promote Red Burns' original vision of putting people at the center of technological innovation. 
We support alumni at all stages of their careers by connecting them to resources to help them succeed. 
ITPAA is an open, transparent, alumni-organized initiative. 
We welcome all members of the ITP community to participate.
